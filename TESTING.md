## Unit Testing

### Coverage

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

####  app

### Error Pages Testing

#### 404.html

I entered a non-existent url to make sure the 404 page appeared.

![404](documentation/testing_files/404-html.png)

#### 500.html

I created a test view with url to test 500 page.

## Bugs

### Solved

* There is a problem with Stripe webhook, one of the events keeps failing everytime the order was going through and the order confirmation email wasn't sending as well, so I decided to move send_confirmation_email function into a checkout_success view and it worked.

```python
def checkout_success(request, order_number):
    """
    Handle successful checkouts
    """

* Stripe js error

I've been having a stripe js error on my profile page and I fixed that by removing the unnecessary stripe block at the end of the html file.

### Unsolved

* As I still have a problem with Stripe webhook, the ```payment_intent.succeeded``` keeps failing. I talked about this with one of the tutors but she said that the code is correct and it should be working. Below is one the screenshot:

* Newsletter messages

The overall newsletter is working but the message for when the user is already signed up for a newsletter is not showing up. The functionality for when the user is already sign up is still working and the user email is not saving to the database if it's already there.

* When you copy the url for add/edit product and the user is not logged in, it redirects you to the sign in page as it supposed to but when you log in as a user and not an admin instead of showing the message that
"Only store owners can do that" it shows this and then after you refresh it shows home page and a message. My views for this functionality seems to be correct, so I don't know what could be causing this.

* Also, in my project I have two media folders because the first time when the media folder was in root directory, the images weren't displaying on the page, so I've decided to move it into static folder and it worked for me. Then, when I have connected Cloudinary, the media folder with all the images was created again in root directory. Due to the shortage of time, I am not able to fix this issue now.
