### Agile Methodology

For this project I used Agile methodology. Agile methodology is a project management approach that prioritizes cross-functional collaboration and continuous improvement. It divides projects into smaller phases and guides teams through cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation.

#### Kanban Board

<details><summary><b>Kanban Board</b></summary>

![Kanban Board](documentation/readme_files/kanban-board.png)
</details>

This a visual representation of my Kanban Board during the project. In addition to three essential columns, I created a column "Product Backlog" later renamed into for the user stories that I wasn't able to implement.
My process was divided into 8 Design (Milestones). Once the iteration is done, all of the user stories from that iteration were going to "Done" column. If any of the user stories from a particular iteration weren't implemented, they were going back to the Product Backlog.

#### Iterations

### Colour Palette

![Color Palette](documentation/readme_files/colour-palette.png)

![Color Palette](documentation/readme_files/colour-palette-two.png)

I picked these colors for the food bowl website to make it look appealing and match the vibe of the delicious meals featured. The chosen colors aim to create a fresh and vibrant feel that suits the type of food on the site. I thought about what users would like and tried to make the website visually attractive, so it feels inviting and enjoyable as they explore the different offerings

### Typography

Playball:

Playball is a font that looks like elegant handwriting. It gives a friendly and personal feel, which is great for making your food bowl website feel welcoming and like it's filled with handmade goodness.

Plus Jakarta Sans:

Plus Jakarta Sans is a clean and modern font without fancy decorations. It helps people easily read and understand your website. It comes in different thickness levels (400, 500, 600), so you can use it for different parts of your site to make things stand out or look more important.

## Ecommerce Business Model

Our food bowl website operates on a Business-to-Customer (B2C) model, focusing on individual transactions without the need for subscriptions. In its early development stages, the site already features a newsletter and links for social media marketing.

Through social media, we aim to cultivate a community of users, leveraging larger platforms like Facebook to boost site visitor numbers. The newsletter serves as a direct communication channel, allowing us to share updates on special offers, new stock, changes to business hours, and notifications of upcoming events. As our website evolves, these features contribute to a user-friendly and engaging experience for our customers.

### Social Media Marketing

Establishing a robust social media presence, characterized by active engagement, and seamlessly connecting it to your business website can significantly boost sales. Opting for widely used platforms with an extensive user community, like Facebook, often results in maximizing website visibility.

![Facebook](documentation/readme_files/facebook-page-one.png)

![Facebook](documentation/readme_files/facebook-page-two.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I integrated a newsletter feature on the website, allowing users to sign up using their email addresses. To prevent duplicate sign-ups, I ensured the email addresses are unique, and if a user attempts to sign up again, a message informs them that they're already subscribed.

```python
def newsletter(request):
    """ Signup to newsletter """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = NewsletterForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            email = form.cleaned_data['email']

            # Check if the email is not already subscribed
            if not Newsletter.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
                # Save the email to the database
                newsletter = Newsletter(email=email)
                newsletter.save()

                # Send confirmation email
                send_confirmation_email(email)

                messages.success(request, 'You have successfully subscribed to our newsletter!')
            else:
                messages.error(request, 'This email is already subscribed to our newsletter.')
            
            return redirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', '/')) 

    else:
        form = NewsletterForm()

    return render(request, 'homepage/index.html', {'form': form})

def send_confirmation_email(email):
    """Send newsletter signup confirmation email"""
    subject = render_to_string(
                'newsletter/welcome_newsletter_subject.txt')
    message = render_to_string('newsletter/welcome_newsletter_body.txt', {'email': email})
    send_mail(subject, message, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, [email])
```

Upon successful subscription, users receive a welcome email triggered by the send_mail() functionality in the views.py file. This email serves as a confirmation of their successful newsletter registration.
